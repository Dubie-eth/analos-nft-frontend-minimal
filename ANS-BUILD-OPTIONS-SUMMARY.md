# 🎯 ANS Program - All Build Options

## ✅ Your Code is 100% Ready!

**Program**: Analos Name Service (ANS)  
**Status**: Code complete, waiting for build  
**Issue**: Infrastructure problems (Playground API down, GitHub Actions failing)

---

## 🚀 Option 1: Wait for Solana Playground (Easiest)

**Status**: ⏳ Playground API currently down (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`)

**Steps**:
1. Keep Playground tab open: https://beta.solpg.io/
2. Your code is already there and correct!
3. Try clicking **Build** every 15-30 minutes
4. Usually recovers within 1-2 hours

**When it works**:
- Click **Build** → Download `.so` file
- Deploy to Analos with the commands in `PLAYGROUND-READY.md`

---

## 🐳 Option 2: Docker Desktop Build (Fastest if Docker works)

**Status**: Docker installed but daemon not running

**Steps**:
1. **Open Docker Desktop** application manually
2. Wait for it to fully start (~2 minutes)
3. Run: `pwsh programs/analos-name-service/docker-build.ps1`
4. Get your `.so` file in `target/deploy/`

**Pros**: Clean environment, works offline  
**Cons**: Requires Docker Desktop running

---

## 💻 Option 3: Local Anchor Build (If You Have It Set Up)

**Requirements**:
- Rust installed
- Solana CLI installed
- Anchor CLI installed

**If you have these**, run:
```bash
cd C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\anal404s\analos-nft-launchpad
anchor build
```

**If you don't have them**, installation takes ~30-45 minutes:
```bash
# 1. Install Rust
# Visit: https://rustup.rs/

# 2. Install Solana (try multiple times if SSL fails)
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.26/install)"

# 3. Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor --tag v0.29.0 anchor-cli --force
```

---

## 🤖 Option 4: GitHub Actions (Currently Broken)

**Status**: ❌ Failing due to Solana installer SSL errors

**What's wrong**: `curl: (35) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL`

**Could be fixed by**: Waiting for Solana's release server to recover

---

## 🎮 Option 5: Try Alternative Playground

Sometimes different playground instances work:

- **Main**: https://solpg.io/ (try without "beta")
- **Beta**: https://beta.solpg.io/
- **With cluster param**: https://beta.solpg.io/?cluster=devnet

---

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree:

**Do you have Docker Desktop open?**
- YES → Run `pwsh programs/analos-name-service/docker-build.ps1`
- NO → Go to Option B

**Can you open Docker Desktop?**
- YES → Open it, wait 2 min, then run build script
- NO → Go to Option C

**Can you wait 30-60 minutes?**
- YES → Wait for Playground to recover, then build there
- NO → You'll need to install Rust/Solana/Anchor locally (45 min setup)

---

## 📊 Comparison:

| Method            | Time to Setup | Time to Build | Success Rate |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Playground (wait) | 0 min (ready) | 30 sec        | 95% (when up)|
| Docker            | 2 min         | 3-5 min       | 99%          |
| Local Anchor      | 45 min        | 1-2 min       | 95%          |
| GitHub Actions    | 0 min         | 5-10 min      | Currently 0% |

---

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**Since your code is already in Playground and correct:**

1. **Try Playground again in 30 minutes** ⏰
2. **Meanwhile, open Docker Desktop** 🐳
3. **If Docker starts, run the build script** ✅
4. **Whichever works first, you're good to go!** 🚀

---

## 📦 What You'll Get:

Once any method succeeds:
- `analos_name_service.so` (the program binary)
- `analos_name_service.json` (the IDL)
- `analos_name_service-keypair.json` (from Playground only)

Then deploy to Analos with:
```bash
solana config set --url https://rpc.analos.io
solana program deploy analos_name_service.so \
  --with-compute-unit-price 1000 \
  --max-sign-attempts 100 \
  --use-quic
```

---

## ❓ What Should We Do?

1. **Wait for Playground** (passive, no setup)
2. **Use Docker** (requires opening Docker Desktop)
3. **Install Anchor locally** (long setup, permanent solution)

**Your call!** 🎯
