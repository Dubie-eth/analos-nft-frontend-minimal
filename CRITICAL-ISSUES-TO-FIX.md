# üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

## Issue #1: ‚ùå Treasury = Admin Wallet (You're Paying Yourself!)

### **Problem:**
```typescript
// src/lib/profile-nft-minting.ts:95
treasuryWallet = '86oK6fa5mKWEAQuZpR6W1wVKajKu7ZpDBa7L2M3RMhpW' // YOUR ADMIN WALLET!
```

When users mint Profile NFTs, the payment goes to **your wallet** (86oK6fa5...), which is ALSO the admin wallet. This means:
- ‚úÖ Payment instruction IS added to transaction
- ‚úÖ Transaction DOES go through
- ‚ùå But you're paying yourself (0 net cost)
- ‚ùå Other users would pay you (but you wouldn't pay anyone)

### **Fix Needed:**
Create a **dedicated treasury wallet** for the platform, separate from admin wallets.

**Options:**
1. **Generate new keypair** for treasury
2. **Use multi-sig** for security
3. **Keep current setup** if you want all payments to go to admin

## Issue #2: ‚ö†Ô∏è Websocket Errors (Non-Critical)

### **Problem:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'connect')
at rb._updateSubscriptions
```

Analos RPC doesn't support WebSockets properly for transaction confirmations.

### **Current Workaround:**
```typescript
// src/lib/profile-nft-minting.ts:77-79
(this.connection as any)._rpcWebSocket = null;
(this.connection as any)._rpcWebSocketConnected = false;
```

This **disables WebSocket** but still works via HTTP polling.

### **Why It Still Shows Errors:**
The `confirmTransaction` function tries to use WebSocket before checking if it's disabled. The error is **cosmetic** - transactions still confirm via fallback.

## Issue #3: ‚úÖ FIXED - Vercel Rebuild Triggered

### **Problem:**
Vercel was serving **old build** without Analos metadata.

### **Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Pushed commit `991a051` to trigger rebuild
- ‚è≥ Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to redeploy
- ‚úÖ New mints will have on-chain metadata

---

## Issue #4: ‚ùì Profile Banner Not Showing

### **Problem:**
User reports: "it does not have my banner"

### **Investigation Needed:**
1. Is banner image uploaded to Supabase?
2. Is `banner_image_url` set in user profile?
3. Is frontend fetching and displaying banner?

### **Check:**
```sql
SELECT banner_image_url, profile_image_url 
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE wallet_address = '86oK6fa5mKWEAQuZpR6W1wVKajKu7ZpDBa7L2M3RMhpW';
```

---

## Issue #5: ‚ùì "Variant as the first one"

### **Problem:**
User says variant is wrong - expecting different one for username "Dubie"

### **Analysis:**
The variant generation is deterministic based on:
```typescript
const variantIndex = username.charCodeAt(0) % PROFILE_VARIANTS.length;
```

For "Dubie":
- `"D".charCodeAt(0)` = 68
- `68 % 6` = 2
- Variant[2] = **"MATRIX"**

### **Expected Behavior:**
Same username = same variant (always)

### **Question for User:**
- Did you use a **different username** before?
- Were you expecting a **different variant**?

---

## Next Steps:

### **Immediate (Do Now):**
1. ‚úÖ Wait for Vercel rebuild (~2-3 min)
2. ‚úÖ Test new mint - should have metadata
3. ‚ùì Check Supabase for banner_image_url
4. ‚ùì Clarify variant issue with user

### **Short-Term (Should Do):**
1. Create dedicated treasury wallet
2. Update `ANALOS_PLATFORM_WALLET` config
3. Add treasury management dashboard
4. Fix WebSocket confirmation (cosmetic)

### **Long-Term (Nice to Have):**
1. Multi-sig treasury for security
2. Automated treasury reports
3. Revenue splitting automation
4. Treasury balance monitoring

## Summary for User:

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Payment IS being collected (to your admin wallet)
- ‚úÖ Profile NFT minted successfully
- ‚úÖ Metadata on IPFS
- ‚úÖ Analos metadata code deployed (rebuilding now)

**What's Confusing:**
- ‚ùì Treasury = Your wallet (not a bug, just confusing)
- ‚ùì Banner not showing (need to check Supabase)
- ‚ùì Variant is "MATRIX" (deterministic from "Dubie")

**What's Being Fixed:**
- ‚è≥ Vercel rebuilding (Analos metadata will work on next mint)
- ‚è≥ WebSocket errors (cosmetic, non-critical)

---

**User Action Needed:**
1. Wait ~3 minutes for Vercel rebuild
2. Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Try minting again (or check existing NFT in explorer)
4. Confirm if you want a separate treasury wallet
5. Check Supabase for banner image
