# Loading Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## For Users Experiencing Loading Problems

If you or your friends are having trouble loading the new version of the app, try these steps:

### 1. **Clear Browser Cache** (Most Common Fix)
The issue is likely due to cached old versions of the app in your browser.

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"
- Or use Hard Refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cache"
- Click "Clear Now"

**Safari:**
- Safari menu â†’ Preferences â†’ Privacy â†’ Manage Website Data
- Remove All

### 2. **Try Incognito/Private Mode**
Open the site in a private/incognito window to bypass cache:
- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Safari: `Cmd + Shift + N`

### 3. **Disable Browser Extensions**
Some wallet extensions or ad blockers can interfere with the app:
- Temporarily disable all extensions
- Try loading the app again
- Re-enable extensions one by one to find the culprit

### 4. **Check Console for Errors**
Open browser developer tools to see what's happening:
- Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- Go to "Console" tab
- Look for red error messages
- Take a screenshot and send to support

### 5. **Try a Different Browser**
Sometimes browser-specific issues occur:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Brave

### 6. **Check Your Internet Connection**
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if other websites are loading properly

### 7. **Wait for Timeout (Automatic)**
The app now has a 5-second automatic timeout:
- If the access check fails, it will automatically allow you in after 5 seconds
- This prevents you from being stuck on loading screens

## Recent Updates (What Changed)

### âœ… Improvements Made:
1. **Graceful Error Handling**: App now continues loading even if backend services are temporarily unavailable
2. **5-Second Timeout**: If page access checks take too long, users are automatically allowed in
3. **Better Network Resilience**: Database failures won't block legitimate users
4. **Navigation Filtering**: Only shows pages you can access based on wallet connection
5. **Improved Loading States**: More informative loading screens

### ðŸ”’ Security Features:
- Pages requiring wallet connection are protected
- Navigation hides inaccessible pages
- Middleware enforces access control at server level
- Database-backed page locking (with fallback if DB unavailable)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Stuck on Loading Screen"
**Solution**: 
- Wait 5 seconds (automatic timeout will kick in)
- Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
- Clear cache and reload

### Issue: "Can't See Navigation Menu"
**Solution**:
- Connect your wallet first
- Public pages (Home, How It Works, FAQ, Features) are always visible
- Other pages appear after wallet connection

### Issue: "Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Detected"
**Solution**:
- This should be fixed in the latest version
- If still occurring: Clear browser cache and reload
- Make sure you don't have multiple tabs open

### Issue: "Page Redirects to Beta Signup"
**Solution**:
- This is expected for locked pages
- Connect your wallet to access protected pages
- Some pages are still in development and will be unlocked soon

### Issue: "Wallet Won't Connect"
**Solution**:
- Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Check if wallet is connected to the correct network (Solana mainnet/devnet)
- Try a different wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)
