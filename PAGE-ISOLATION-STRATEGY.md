# Page Isolation Strategy for Staged Rollouts

## Overview
Implement isolated development and deployment system for marketing-driven page rollouts while maintaining existing functionality.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Zero-Impact Development**
- Each page/feature is completely isolated
- Changes to one page NEVER affect others
- Working features remain untouched during development

### 2. **Marketing-Driven Rollouts**
- Deploy pages as needed for marketing campaigns
- Brand and adapt based on user feedback
- Maintain flexibility for user-driven changes

### 3. **Production Safety**
- Whitelist system remains stable
- NFT minting/contracts unaffected
- Marketplace trading continues uninterrupted

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Isolation (Current)
- ✅ Profile page isolated with CSS modules
- ✅ CSP fixes for wallet connections
- ✅ Development isolation guide created

### Phase 2: Page-by-Page Isolation
Each page gets its own:
- CSS Module (`.module.css`)
- Component boundaries
- Feature flag system
- Independent testing

### Phase 3: Staged Deployment System
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- A/B testing capabilities
- User feedback collection
- Quick rollback mechanisms

## Page Priority Matrix

### **Tier 1: Critical (Never Touch)**
- Wallet connection system
- NFT minting contracts
- Whitelist management
- Marketplace trading

### **Tier 2: Marketing Pages (Isolate & Deploy)**
- Landing page
- How it works
- Collections showcase
- User profiles
- Social features

### **Tier 3: Experimental (Safe to Iterate)**
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics pages
- Beta features
- User onboarding

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Module Pattern
```css
/* PageName.module.css */
.pageContainer {
  /* Page-specific styles only */
}
```

### Feature Flag System
```typescript
// Feature flags for gradual rollouts
const FEATURES = {
  NEW_LANDING: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_LANDING === 'true',
  ENHANCED_PROFILE: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENHANCED_PROFILE === 'true',
  SOCIAL_FEATURES: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_FEATURES === 'true'
};
```

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Development Branch**: `feature/page-name-isolation`
2. **Testing**: Isolated component testing
3. **Staging**: Feature flag enabled for testing
4. **Production**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
5. **Feedback**: User feedback collection
6. **Iteration**: Refine based on data

## Benefits

### For Development
- ✅ Safe parallel development
- ✅ No cross-page contamination
- ✅ Faster iteration cycles
- ✅ Reduced debugging time

### For Marketing
- ✅ Deploy pages as campaigns need them
- ✅ A/B test different versions
- ✅ Quick pivots based on user response
- ✅ Brand flexibility

### For Users
- ✅ Stable core functionality
- ✅ Smooth new feature introduction
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Feedback-driven improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Audit Current Pages**: Identify which need isolation
2. **Create CSS Modules**: For each page that needs updates
3. **Implement Feature Flags**: For staged rollouts
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: Track user engagement and feedback
5. **Establish Workflow**: Clear process for marketing-driven deployments

## Success Metrics
- Zero downtime during page updates
- No impact on core functionality
- Faster page deployment cycles
- Improved user engagement on new pages
- Reduced development conflicts

This system ensures we can iterate rapidly on marketing pages while keeping our core NFT/marketplace functionality rock-solid.
