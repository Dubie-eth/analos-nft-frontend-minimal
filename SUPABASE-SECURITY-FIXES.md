## 🔍 What Each Fix Does

### 1️⃣ Function Search Path (26 warnings)
**Problem:** Functions without explicit `search_path` can be exploited through schema poisoning.

**Fix:** Added `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to all 26 functions.

**Affected Functions:**
- Leaderboard: `update_leaderboard`, `get_user_rank`, `get_top_referrers`
- Encryption: `encrypt_sensitive_data`, `decrypt_sensitive_data`, `get_encryption_key`
- Verification: `calculate_verification_score`, `check_verification_eligibility`
- User Points: `increment_activity_points`, `increment_referral_points`, `get_user_stats`
- Referrals: `check_referral_code`, `get_referral_history`
- Campaigns: `get_campaign_stats`, `check_user_eligibility`, `check_wallet_eligibility`
- Admin: `cleanup_old_security_logs`, `get_security_statistics`
- Collections: `get_collection_stats`, `calculate_creator_rewards`, `update_collection_sales`
- Rewards: `get_user_total_rewards`, `get_user_rewards_summary`
- Whitelist: `add_to_whitelist`
- Maintenance: `update_updated_at_column`

### 2️⃣ Security Definer View (1 error)
**Problem:** `public.encryption_test` view runs with elevated privileges.

**Fix:** Dropped the test view entirely (it was just for testing).

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.encryption_test CASCADE;
```

### 3️⃣ RLS Policies Missing (4 info warnings)
**Problem:** Tables have RLS enabled but no policies, making them inaccessible.

**Fixes Applied:**

#### `database_backups`
- ✅ Admins can view/insert backups
- ❌ Regular users blocked

#### `social_verification_audit`
- ✅ Users can view their own audit logs
- ✅ System can create audit entries

#### `user_activities`
- ✅ Users can view their own activities
- ✅ Admins can view all activities
- ✅ System can create activity logs

#### `verification_request_accounts`
- ✅ Users can view/insert/update their own verification accounts
- ❌ Users blocked from accessing others' data

## 🚨 Important Notes

### About `encryption_test` View
If you actually need this view for testing, recreate it as **SECURITY INVOKER** instead:

```sql
CREATE VIEW public.encryption_test 
WITH (security_invoker=true) AS
  SELECT * FROM your_encrypted_table;
```

### About RLS Policies
The policies assume you're using JWT authentication with `wallet_address` claim. If you use a different auth pattern, adjust the policies:

```sql
-- For user ID based auth
auth.uid() = user_id

-- For email based auth
auth.email() = user_email

-- For wallet based auth (our current setup)
auth.jwt() ->> 'wallet_address' = wallet_address
```
