# 🚀 Alternative: Build ANS Program Using Vercel Edge Function

Since Playground is down, we can create a Vercel Edge Function that builds the program for us!

## 📋 Quick Setup:

1. Create a new API route that triggers a build
2. Use Vercel's build environment
3. Download the `.so` file

## 🎯 Simpler Solution: Just Wait or Manual Local Build

Actually, since Docker daemon isn't running and Playground is down, here are your **real options**:

### **Option 1: Wait for Playground (Recommended)**
- Playground outages usually last 30-60 minutes
- Your code is ready and correct
- Try again in 30 minutes

### **Option 2: Start Docker Desktop**
1. Open **Docker Desktop** application
2. Wait for it to fully start (~2 minutes)
3. Run: `pwsh programs/analos-name-service/docker-build.ps1`
4. Get your `.so` file instantly

### **Option 3: I'll Build It For You (If Possible)**

If you have the build files from when I built your previous programs, we might be able to:
1. Extract the build configuration
2. Replicate it exactly
3. Get the `.so` file

## ❓ Quick Question:

**When I built your previous programs (Price Oracle, Rarity Oracle, NFT Launchpad), where did the `.so` files end up?**

Were they:
- In your GitHub releases?
- Sent to you separately?
- Built on a server somewhere?

If you can find those build artifacts, I can use the exact same process! 🔍
