-- FIX TIER ALLOCATION MISMATCH
-- ============================================
-- Problem: Community WL mints showing in PUBLIC, not in COMMUNITY
-- Solution: Resync all mints to correct tiers based on wallet & balance

-- 1. Check current allocation table vs actual mints
-- ==================================================
SELECT 'CURRENT ALLOCATION TABLE:' as info;
SELECT * FROM los_bros_allocations ORDER BY tier;

SELECT 'ACTUAL MINTS BY TIER IN DATABASE:' as info;
SELECT 
    los_bros_tier as tier,
    COUNT(*) as actual_count,

FROM profile_nfts
WHERE los_bros_token_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY los_bros_tier
ORDER BY los_bros_tier;

-- 2. Identify team wallet mints
-- ==================================================
SELECT 'TEAM WALLET MINTS:' as info;
SELECT 
    wallet_address,
    los_bros_token_id,
    los_bros_tier,
    CASE 
        WHEN wallet_address IN (

    END as validation

  )

-- 3. Fix any non-TEAM wallets that shouldn't be TEAM
-- ==================================================
